- You can automate the generation of shadows up to 20 PNG files. Make sure you use PNG and transparent background to utilize the functionality of this script. Rename your files as Picture1, Picture2, ..., Picture20. This script will generate an error if only one image is found or less than the required number, 20 pictures. Make sure your PNG files are having transparent background to make it more functional.
